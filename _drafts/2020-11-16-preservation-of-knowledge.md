In the late 2019 there was a HN post about meta-repository or til repositories, git repositories where people documented things they learnt.

Inspired by https://github.com/jbranchaud/til which has 960 articles and https://github.com/yoshuawuyts/notes a huge member of the Rust community

From 2019-12-29 I started to create my own meta-repository

My goals were the following:
- Keep everthing human readable and editable
- Try to capture things that are not going to change
- Keep it easy to search

And after close to 1 year I have collected 100 articles
