I completed making a `senbazuru` on `2020-09-18`.

### What is this?

For those of you new to the term `senbazuru` or `One Thousand Origami Cranes` is a group of 1000 origami cranes held together by a string. Making an origami crane is simple but creating one thousand cranes is a test of the will, the challenge is to persist till the goal of a 1000 cranes is achieved. It took me 24 days to complete the whole thing even with a an average of 40+ cranes per day.

### Why did you do it?

Some stories believe you are granted happiness and eternal good luck, instead of just one wish, such as long life or recovery from illness or injury.
